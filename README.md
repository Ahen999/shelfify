# shelfify
The goal of this project is to develop an empty shelf space detection and classification computer vision model that can be used in retail environments, using the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known as YOLOv8. With regard to the inventory management of the business, this project will improve the ability to monitor shelves through automation so that there can be quicker reactions to replenishment, a reduction in out-of-stock occurrences by customers, and better overall customer satisfaction.
The two datasets utilized are the "Supermarket Shelves Dataset" from Kaggle and the "Marico" dataset from Roboflow Universe. These datasets contained images of supermarket shelves annotated with a single class label, "empty-spaces," through the use of Roboflow Annotate. In all, 313 images were manually labeled and various data augmentation techniques were carried out within these â€” a variety of horizontal flips, brightness and contrast adjustments, rotation, Gaussian blur, and many more. The dataset breaks down to 224 training images, 59 validation images, and 30 testing images with all images resampled to 640x640 for consistency.
Model architecture
YOLOv8 was chosen since it features real-time object detection. The training included a total number of 150 epochs, batch size of 16, on augmented images to help the model generalize well to unseen conditions such as different lighting and shelf angles. Some performance metrics, like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, were tracked to find the accuracy of the model. It showed that the performance in detection was strong with a well-balanced trade-off between Precision and Recall, and F1 scores show the sum of both the precision and recall of the model.
Besides the core functionality of detection, the model incorporated an automated alert system. It is useful for sending notifications whenever there is a detection of an empty shelf. This adds practicality value in that it allows retailers to act immediately once the model identifies empty spaces on the shelves. The alerts can be directed to appropriate personnel or any inventory system. This will ensure restocking in real-time and avert potential losses from missed sales as a result of out-of-stock items.
In summary, the project actually comes with a demonstration power of high-level deep learning techniques like YOLOv8, and it demonstrates such systems can be extended to practical applications. Adding an alert system further increases the real-world impact of the project by automating shelf monitoring and inventory management in an efficiency manner. Later versions of the system might extend further into more general retail management systems, which renders supply chain operations even less labor-intensive.
